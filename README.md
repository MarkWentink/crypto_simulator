# Build-a-Bot Crypto Trading Simulator

In this repository, you will find code underpinning the Build-a-Bot streamlit app.

The code for the app sits in the `pages` folder, while most of the trading bot implementation lives in the classes defined in `crypto_bot_classes.py`.

Visit the app at https://build-a-bot.streamlit.app/

You can read more about the implementation on my blog, [Data Science Every Day](https://dsed.uk/posts/cryptobot_data/).
